📌 Customer Churn Analysis — Project Summary

This project analyzes customer churn to understand why customers leave and which factors contribute most to churn. The workflow includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insights based on visualizations.

🔧 Data Preparation

Replaced blank values in Total Charges where tenure = 0.

Converted binary fields (e.g., SeniorCitizen 0/1) into meaningful labels (Yes/No) for better readability.

📊 Key Findings

Overall churn rate: ~26.54% of customers.

Senior Citizens: Higher likelihood of churn compared to non-seniors.

Tenure: Customers with short tenure (1–2 months) churn significantly more; long-term customers tend to stay.

Contract Type: Month-to-month contract customers show the highest churn rate, unlike 1- and 2-year contract customers.

Services & Features: Clear churn patterns are visible across service attributes (internet service, add-ons, etc.).

Payment Method: Customers paying via electronic checks are more likely to churn.

🎯 Project Objective

To identify patterns and high-risk customer segments, helping businesses reduce churn through targeted interventions.
